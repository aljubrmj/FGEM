**FGEM** (/if'gem/) is an open-source Python library for evaluating lifecycle techno-economics of baseload and flexible geothermal energy projects. It performs sequential simulations spanning hourly to yearly timestepping using anlytical, numerical, and iterative models. It also simulates hybrid systems involving storage facilities (e.g., thermal energy storage tanks and Lithium-ion battery units).
