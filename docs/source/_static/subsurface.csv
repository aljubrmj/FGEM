drilling_cost,USD/meter,bool,"geothermal well drilling cost in USD/meter. If not specified, correlations are used to estimate drilling cost as a function of measured depth.",
reservoir_type,,str,"type of reservoir model. Options are (1) ""percentage_decline"" for PercentageDecline, (2) ""energy_decline"" for EnergyDecline, (3) ""diffusion_convection"" for DiffusionConvection, and (4) ""uloop"" for ULoop. For simulating conventional geothermal or enhanced geothermal systems, we recommend ""diffusion_convection"" as it is an anlytical solution. Models ""percentage_decline"" and ""energy_decline"" are conceptual. Meanwhile, ""uloop"" is used to simulate U-Loop closed loop systems.","""diffusion_convection"""
